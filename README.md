# Emergency-Response-Optimization

The Emergency Response System, a C++-based program, was developed to optimize emergency management through efficient resource allocation, including police cars, fire departments, and ambulances. The system distributes resources based on the severity and closeness of incidents by using complex data structures like graphs to model resources and their interactions. It integrates with the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) API to calculate dynamic, real-time routes for resource dispatch while accounting for traffic conditions, hence improving Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) forecasts. The goals are to improve coordination, decrease reaction times, and save lives in emergency situations.
The feature of resource allocation, which locates and dispatches emergency resources based on the location and severity of the incident, is one of the system's main characteristics. The system ensures that high-priority crises, including fires or medical emergencies, are addressed first by controlling event severity through a priority queue. The fastest routes to the given locations are determined using the OSRM API, which also provides real-time traffic data to adjust ETA predictions. The system also produces detailed reports on resource deployment, including distances, traffic-adjusted ETAs, and detailed routing information, to help operators manage resources efficiently.The haversine formula is used to locate the inident input within 20km radius as our system supports locations wihtin 20km only.
In operation, the system relies on a graph structure to model resources as nodes, with attributes like location, availability, and specialization. It uses a priority queue to manage incident severity and ensure critical emergencies are prioritized. The OSRM API is integrated to calculate the optimal routes for dispatch teams, factoring in real-time traffic to adjust ETA predictions. The system is designed to scale, with the ability to handle an increasing number of resources and incidents. Future enhancements may include the integration of IoT for real-time tracking, improving the system's flexibility and responsiveness.
