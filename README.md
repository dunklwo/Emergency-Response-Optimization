# Emergency-Response-Optimization

The Emergency Response System, a C++-based program, was developed to optimize emergency management through efficient resource allocation, including police cars, fire departments, and ambulances. The system distributes resources based on the severity and closeness of incidents by using complex data structures like graphs to model resources and their interactions. It integrates with the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) API to calculate dynamic, real-time routes for resource dispatch while accounting for traffic conditions, hence improving Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) forecasts. The goals are to improve coordination, decrease reaction times, and save lives in emergency situations.
The feature of resource allocation, which locates and dispatches emergency resources based on the location and severity of the incident, is one of the system's main characteristics. The system ensures that high-priority crises, including fires or medical emergencies, are addressed first by controlling event severity through a priority queue. The fastest routes to the given locations are determined using the OSRM API, which also provides real-time traffic data to adjust ETA predictions. The system also produces detailed reports on resource deployment, including distances, traffic-adjusted ETAs, and detailed routing information, to help operators manage resources efficiently.The haversine formula is used to locate the inident input within 20km radius as our system supports locations wihtin 20km only.
In operation, the system relies on a graph structure to model resources as nodes, with attributes like location, availability, and specialization. It uses a priority queue to manage incident severity and ensure critical emergencies are prioritized. The OSRM API is integrated to calculate the optimal routes for dispatch teams, factoring in real-time traffic to adjust ETA predictions. The system is designed to scale, with the ability to handle an increasing number of resources and incidents. Future enhancements may include the integration of IoT for real-time tracking, improving the system's flexibility and responsiveness.
CONCLUSION
 The Emergency Response System (ERS) is designed to improve the efficiency of
 resource allocation and dispatch in emergency situations. By leveraging data structures
 such as priority queues, graphs, and vectors, the system automates incident
 management and ensures that resources are allocated based on severity and proximity.
 The integration of the OSRM API allows for real-time route optimization, which accounts
 for traffic conditions and calculates accurate ETAs for dispatch teams. The system
 successfully meets the objectives of automating resource allocation, prioritizing
13
 incidents by severity, and providing accurate routing information, ensuring the most
 critical emergencies are handled first.
 Achievement of Objectives
 ● Automated Resource Allocation: The system dynamically assigns resources (e.g.,
 fire brigades, ambulances, police vans) based on the severity and location of
 incidents, minimizing response time and improving efficiency.
 ● Prioritization of Incidents: Using a priority queue, the system ensures that the
 most urgent incidents are addressed first, optimizing emergency management.
 ● Real-Time Route Optimization: The integration with the OSRM API enables
 dynamic route planning, ensuring the fastest paths are chosen, considering
 current traffic conditions.
 ● Traffic-Aware ETA Predictions: The system adjusts ETAs by incorporating
 real-time traffic data, providing accurate arrival estimates for dispatch teams.
 ● Scalability and Flexibility: The system's modular design allows for future
 expansion, supporting additional resources and integration with other systems.
 Future Work and Recommendations
 ● Real-Time GPS Tracking: Future versions of the system could include real-time
 tracking of resources during transit, allowing for dynamic route adjustments if
 conditions change.
 ● AI Integration for Predictive Analysis: Machine learning models could be
 incorporated to predict high-risk areas, enabling proactive resource allocation
 even before incidents occur.
 ● Enhanced Traffic Data Integration: Incorporating more detailed, real-time traffic
 data (e.g., from government traffic monitoring systems) could further enhance the
 accuracy of route planning and ETAs.
 ● Multi-City/Regional Expansion: The system could be scaled to handle incidents
 across multiple cities or regions, with a centralized control system to manage
 resources over a larger geographic area.
 ● Support for Additional Resource Types: The system could be extended to include
 other types of emergency resources such as helicopters or drones, further
 improving emergency response capabilities.
